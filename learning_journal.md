# My Learning Journal: Q-Grid Project

**Date: October 4, 2025**

**Today's Goal:** Set up the complete project workspace for the hackathon.

**What I did:**
* Created the public GitHub repository.
* Cloned the project to my local machine.
* Set up a Python virtual environment to keep things organized.
* Installed Qiskit, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

**What I Learned:**
* Learned the importance of using a `.gitignore` for Python projects to keep unnecessary files out of the repository.
* This is my first time setting up a dedicated virtual environment for a project.

**Next Steps:**
* Tomorrow, I will start modeling the actual smart grid problem in a Google Collab
# My Learning Journal: Q-Grid Project

**Date: October 5, 2025**

**Today's Goal:** Implement the VQE solver to get a quantum solution for our grid problem.

**What I did:**
* Successfully translated our classical optimization model into the quantum-ready QUBO format.
* Attempted to implement the VQE solver to find the solution.
* Ran into significant and persistent technical challenges with the Google Colab environment and Qiskit library versions. We faced a series of `AttributeError`, `TypeError`, and `ModuleNotFound` errors.

**What I Learned:**
* **"Dependency Hell" is a real and critical part of software development.** I learned that simply installing a library isn't enough; you have to manage specific versions to ensure all parts of the code are compatible. This is a crucial real-world lesson.
* **Debugging Strategies:** I learned how to debug a difficult environment issue. We systematically tried multiple solutions: forcing library upgrades, switching to legacy code syntax, and finally, doing a full environment reset in a new notebook with locked library versions.
* **Persistence is Key:** The most important lesson was not giving up. Instead of getting blocked by the errors, the goal became to understand the *source* of the errors (version mismatches) and find a systematic way to solve them. This is what separates a good developer from a great one.

**Next Steps:**
* Get a final, working result from the corrected code.
* Begin the process of analyzing and interpreting the quantum solution.
