# My Learning Journal: Q-Grid Project

**Date: October 4, 2025**

**Today's Goal:** Set up the complete project workspace for the hackathon.

**What I did:**
* Created the public GitHub repository.
* Cloned the project to my local machine.
* Set up a Python virtual environment to keep things organized.
* Installed Qiskit, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

**What I Learned:**
* Learned the importance of using a `.gitignore` for Python projects to keep unnecessary files out of the repository.
* This is my first time setting up a dedicated virtual environment for a project.

**Next Steps:**
* Tomorrow, I will start modeling the actual smart grid problem in a Google Collab
